# SQL-CASE-STUDIES-CHALLENGE
 # 1. Case Study #1 - Danny's Diner
## Problem Statement
Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their visiting patterns, how much money theyâ€™ve spent and also which menu items are their favourite. Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers.

He plans on using these insights to help him decide whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty program - additionally he needs help to generate some basic datasets so his team can easily inspect the data without needing to use SQL.

Danny has provided you with a sample of his overall customer data due to privacy issues!

Danny has shared with you 3 key datasets for this case study:
1. sales
2. menu
3. members

### Questions:
* What is the total amount each customer spent at the restaurant?<br>
